  Fetch film and TV series data from Filmweb.pl: search by title, rating and number
  of votes, critics rating, genres, duration, directors, cast, plot, premiere dates,
  where to watch (VOD providers and prices) and actor details. Use whenever the user
  asks about a movie or series on Filmweb, pastes a filmweb.pl link, or wants a Polish
  rating, opis, obsada or VOD info, e.g. "ile Matrix ma na Filmwebie", "kto grał w…",
  "kto wyreżyserował…", "o czym jest…", "gdzie obejrzę…", "kiedy premiera…".

# Filmweb

Fetches data from the JSON API behind www.filmweb.pl using a small dependency-free
Python CLI, `scripts/filmweb.py`, that always prints JSON.

## Running the script

Run from this skill's directory. Use whichever Python launcher exists:

| OS | Command |
|---|---|
| Linux / macOS | `python3 scripts/filmweb.py <command> …` |
| Windows | `py scripts/filmweb.py <command> …` (or `python`) |

No installation step is needed.

## Workflow

1. **Get the Filmweb ID.**
   - The user gave a link → `filmweb.py id "<url>"` (offline).
     The ID is the trailing number of the slug: `filmweb.pl/film/Matrix-1999-628` → `628`.
   - The user gave a title → `filmweb.py search "<title>"`. Results are ordered by relevance.
     If several titles plausibly match (remakes, sequels, film vs. series), check them with
     `film` and pick by year, or ask the user.
2. **Fetch only what the question needs.**
   - rating, genres, director, short plot → `film`
   - "who played in…" → `cast` (`film` already has the two main actors)
   - "where can I watch…" → `vod`
   - "when is the premiere…" → `dates`
   - full plot → `description`; details about a person → `person <personId>`
3. **Answer in the user's language** and cite the `url` from `film`. Round the rating to one
   decimal and mention the number of votes (e.g. "7,6/10 z 872 tys. ocen"). Give VOD prices in zł.

## Commands

| Command | Returns |
|---|---|
| `search "<query>" [--type=film\|serial\|game] [--limit=10]` | list of `{id, type, title, mainCast}` |
| `film <id\|url>` | title, originalTitle, year, type, url, posterUrl, rating, votesCount, votesDistribution, criticsRating, genres, countries, duration, directors, mainCast, plot |
| `description <id\|url>` | full plot description |
| `cast <id\|url> [--limit=10]` | top-rated roles: personId, name, profession, roleRating |
| `dates <id\|url>` | worldPremiere, worldRelease, polandRelease, polandReissue |
| `vod <id\|url>` | where to watch: provider, link, availability, offers (subscription / free / rent / buy + price in PLN) |
| `person <personId>` | name, realName, birthDate, birthplace, height, profession, photoUrl, knownForIds, url |
| `id <url>` | `{"id": …}`, offline |

## Exit codes

JSON goes to stdout; errors go to stderr as `{"error": "...", "type": "..."}`.

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | success | use the JSON |
| `2` | not found | tell the user; double-check the ID |
| `64` | bad usage | fix the arguments |
| `69` | Filmweb / network error | retry once; if it persists, use the fallback |

## Fallback

The API is unofficial and may change or be blocked by the network. If the script keeps
failing with code `69`, or the user needs data it does not provide (character names, reviews,
comments, full crew), fetch the public page (`url` from `film`, or `https://www.filmweb.pl/film/<slug>-<id>`)
with a web-fetch tool or `curl` and read the data from it. Tell the user the data came from the web page.

## Rules

- Don't call `film` for every search hit "just in case"; check only the candidates you need.
- Don't invent data the script did not return.
